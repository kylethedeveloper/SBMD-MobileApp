# Smart Baby Monitoring

This application is developed as a capstone project called Smart Baby Monitoring Device.
It will communicate to a Raspberry Pi device through Firebase.

#### First things first

This project **will not** work if you just clone and run it.
You need to import your **own** *google-services.json* file which is needed to connect to your own Firebase instance. I removed the original one for the sake of *security*.
